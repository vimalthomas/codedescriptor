The model includes methods for training, predicting the next token, and generating text sequences.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Components of <code>GRULanguageModel</code></strong>:
1. <strong>Embedding Layer</strong>: Maps vocabulary indices into embedding vectors and handles padding.
2. <strong>GRU Layer</strong>: Processes the sequence data, capable of using multiple layers and handling dropout for regularization.
3. <strong>Dropout Layer</strong>: Applied after the GRU to prevent overfitting.
4. <strong>Fully Connected Layer</strong>: Maps the output of the GRU to the vocabulary size for prediction.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong>:
- <strong><code>forward</code></strong>: Takes input tokens and an optional hidden state to produce logits for each token and an updated hidden state.
- <strong><code>predict_next_token</code></strong>: Generates the next token in a sequence by providing the model with the current state and the last token input, using a temperature parameter to control randomness in prediction.
- <strong><code>generate</code></strong>: Generates a sequence of text starting from a given prompt. It supports different modes such as generating a fixed maximum length sequence and returning either the full generated sequence or just the continuation beyond the prompt.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>train_model function:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>It takes parameters such as the model, data loaders for training and validation, tokenizer, device, and others to set up and run the training process. </li>
<li>The function initializes the optimizer (<code>AdamW</code>) and learning rate scheduler, sets a criterion for loss calculation, and then loops over the specified number of epochs to train the model on the training data.</li>
<li>During each epoch, the model's training and validation losses are calculated and printed. The model state is saved whenever a new best validation loss is achieved.</li>
<li>Losses across all epochs are plotted and saved using the <code>plot_losses</code> function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>plot_losses function:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Used to visually depict the training and validation loss per epoch using matplotlib. It saves the plot as an image file using a timestamp in its filename.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>evaluate_model function:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It loads the best-performing model state, evaluates it on a test dataset, and computes the loss.</li>
<li>Additionally, it calculates the BLEU score (a metric for evaluating text which compares n-grams of the candidate with n-grams of the reference data) to assess the linguistic quality of model outputs as compared to actual target sequences.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The script also imports necessary libraries for its operations, including PyTorch for modeling and computation, tqdm for progress bars during training loops, and NLTK for calculating BLEU scores.

It also sets up positional embeddings for sequences up to a defined maximum length and applies dropout for regularization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Forward Pass (<code>forward</code>)</strong>: This method processes input tokens through embeddings and the Transformer encoder. It applies a sequence-dependent mask (for causal attention) and a padding mask to handle varying input lengths and pad tokens respectively, while also combining token and position embeddings with dropout. The output is then passed through a linear layer to transform encoder output into vocabulary-sized logits for each position in the input sequence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Helper Method (<code>_generate_square_subsequent_mask</code>)</strong>: Generates a triangular (upper triangular filled with <code>True</code> values starting from the diagonal) mask to prevent future positions from influencing the prediction at the current position, used for imposing the autoregressive property in the sequence generation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction Method (<code>predict_next_token</code>)</strong>: This methods performs a forward pass through the model to obtain logits for the last token position, which are then scaled by a temperature parameter, and processed using softmax to get probabilities. The next token is sampled from these probabilities, ensuring that the beginning-of-sequence token is not selected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Text Generation (<code>generate</code>)</strong>: This function takes a text prompt, tokenizes it, and then uses the model to autoregressively generate text by repeatedly predicting the next token until a maximum length or the end-of-sequence token is reached. The generated text can either include the prompt or just the continuation, according to the <code>return_continuation_only</code> parameter.</p></li>

<h2>Top-level Functions</h2>

<ul>
<li>train_model: The <code>train_model</code> function is designed to train a machine learning model using the provided training and testing datasets, with customization for learning parameters and model saving.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an outline of its functionality:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Initialization</strong>: It initializes the AdamW optimizer with a specified learning rate (<code>lr</code>) and a scheduler to reduce the learning rate based on the validation loss performance. A cross-entropy loss function integrates an 'ignore_index' for the padding token from the tokenizer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Loop</strong>: Over a series of epochs (default 30):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Train Phase</strong>: For each batch from the <code>train_loader</code>, it computes the loss between the model outputs and targets, backpropagates to update model weights, and accumulates the train loss.</li>
<li><strong>Validation Phase</strong>: The model is set to evaluation mode to prevent updates during validation. It calculates the validation loss for batches from the <code>test_loader</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Logging and Learning Rate Adjustment</strong>: After each epoch, the average losses for training and validation are calculated and printed. The learning rate scheduler may adjust the learning rate based on the validation loss.</li>
<li><strong>Model Saving</strong>: If the validation loss improves (i.e., decreases below the previously best recorded validation loss), the model's state dictionary is saved to the specified path.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Loss Plotting</strong>: After training, it plots the training and validation loss evolution over the epochs using a helper function, helping to visualize the model's learning progress.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The function effectively handles the entire training and validation process, including dynamic updates of learning parameters and tracking of performance metrics, while saving the best-performing model state.</p>

<ul>
<li>plot_losses: The provided function, <code>plot_losses</code>, takes three parameters: <code>train_losses</code> and <code>val_losses</code>, which are lists representing the loss during training and validation respectively, and an optional parameter <code>model_name</code> set to "model" by default. The function generates a plot displaying both the training and validation loss curves and titles the plot using the name of the model converted to uppercase followed by "Loss Curve". The x-axis represents epochs, and the y-axis represents loss. It includes a legend to differentiate between the training and validation curves.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plot is saved as a PNG file named using the model name, the phrase "loss_curve", and the current timestamp to ensure the filename is unique. The function then closes the plot to free up memory and prints out a message indicating where the loss curve was saved, showing the filename. The filename includes a dynamically generated timestamp to ensure it is unique each time the function is run.</p>

<ul>
<li>evaluate_model: The function <code>evaluate_model</code> is designed to load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance on test data, specifically assessing its perplexity (PPL) and BLEU score. The process involves the following steps:</li>
</ul>

<ol>

<li><p><strong>Evaluation Mode</strong>: Sets the model to evaluation mode (<code>model.eval()</code>), which turns off certain features like dropout.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loss Function</strong>: Initializes a <code>CrossEntropyLoss</code> for the model, which ignores padded indices in sequences as defined by the tokenizer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preparation for Metrics Calculation</strong>: The variables <code>total_loss</code> and <code>bleu_scores</code> are initialized to accumulate the loss values and compute BLEU scores across all test data batches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation Loop</strong>: Iterates over <code>test_loader</code> which contains batches of input and target sequences.</p>

<ul>
<li>The function moves the current batch to the specified <code>device</code>.</li>
<li>It computes the logits of the model and evaluates the batch loss.</li>
<li>Accumulates the computed loss to <code>total_loss</code>.</li>

</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>This script is structured to facilitate the preprocessing and loading of text data, utilizing PyTorch's capabilities for efficient handling of sequences and batch preparation, which are essential steps in the pipeline of training models for natural language processing tasks.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<ul>
<li>TextDataset: The <code>TextDataset</code> class, derived from <code>Dataset</code>, is designed to process text data for natural language processing tasks. It initializes by loading text samples from a specified file and tokenizing them into numerical IDs using the provided tokenizer. The key steps and features of this class are as follows:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Initialization (<code>__init__</code>):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The constructor takes three parameters: <code>filepath</code> for the dataset file, <code>tokenizer</code> for converting text to tokens, and <code>max_seq_len</code> to limit the sequence length of tokens.</li>
<li>The text file is read line by line, and each line is expected to be a JSON object with keys 'prompt' and 'completion'. These values are concatenated, stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, and fed into the tokenizer.</li>
<li>The tokenizer encodes the concatenated text to produce a sequence of token IDs, capped at <code>max_seq_len</code>. The sequence includes beginning-of-sentence (<code>bos</code>) and end-of-sentence (<code>eos</code>) tokens.</li>
<li>Only sequences with at least 2 tokens are added to the dataset (<code>self.samples</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Length (<code>__len__</code>):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This method returns the number of samples in the dataset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Item Access (<code>__getitem__</code>):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Retrieves a specific sample by its index (<code>idx</code>). This method is used to access individual token sequences in the dataset.</li>
<li>For each sample accessed, it returns a pair of tensors: the input sequence (<code>tokens[:-1]</code>) and the target sequence (<code>tokens[1:]</code>). This setup is typical in language modeling, where the model predicts the next token in a sequence based on the previous tokens.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, the <code>TextDataset</code> class neatly packages text data into manageable sequences useful for training language models, providing functionality to both preprocess and access the data efficiently.</p>

<h2>Top-level Functions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>add<em>special</em>tokens: The function <code>add_special_tokens</code> takes a tuple of two lists of strings as input, representing pairs of prompts and completions. It processes each pair to add special tokens: <code>&lt;bos&gt;</code> (beginning of sentence) is prepended to prompts that start with an uppercase letter, and <code>&lt;eos&gt;</code> (end of sentence) is appended to completions that end with punctuation marks (period, question mark, or exclamation point). The function returns a tuple containing two lists: one for the modified prompts and the other for the modified completions. This helps in marking the beginning and end points of sentences within the dataset, which could be useful for training language models or other NLP applications.</p></li>
<li><p>collate_fn: The <code>collate_fn</code> function is designed to process a batch of data, ensuring that both inputs and targets are appropriately padded to the same length for batch processing in neural network models. Here's a step-by-step summary of what this function does:</p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Unpacking the Batch</strong>: The function takes two parameters: <code>batch</code>, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an <code>input</code> sequence and a corresponding <code>target</code> sequence; and <code>pad_val</code>, which specifies the padding value to use for sequences shorter than the maximum length in the batch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Separating Inputs and Targets</strong>: Using <code>zip(*batch)</code>, the function separates the inputs and targets from the batch into separate tuples.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Padding the Sequences</strong>: It uses the <code>pad_sequence</code> method from <code>nn.utils.rnn</code> for both <code>inputs</code> and <code>targets</code>. This method adjusts the length of all sequences in each tuple to match the longest sequence by adding the <code>pad_val</code> value at the end of shorter sequences. The <code>batch_first=True</code> argument ensures that the batch dimension is at the first axis (i.e., the shape of the output tensor will be <code>[batch_size, max_seq_length]</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Returning Processed Batch</strong>: The function returns a tuple containing the padded <code>inputs</code> and <code>targets</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This function is particularly useful when building models that handle sequences of varying lengths, such as those commonly found in natural language processing or time series analysis, allowing for efficient batch processing in deep learning architectures.</p>

It returns the logits and the hidden states.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Token Prediction</strong>: The <code>predict_next_token</code> method predicts the next token given a sequence of input IDs, a beginning-of-sentence (<code>bos_id</code>) token to prevent its generation, hidden states, and temperature for smoothing.

<li><p>LSTMLanguageModel: The class <code>LSTMLanguageModel</code> is a PyTorch neural network model that extends <code>nn.Module</code>. It's designed to generate language based on an LSTM architecture. The model initialization receives several parameters to configure the LSTM and associated layers:</p></li>
<li><p><code>vocab_size</code>: the size of the vocabulary.</p></li>
<li><code>embed_dim</code>: the dimensionality of the embedding layer.</li>
<li><code>hidden_dim</code>: the number of features in the hidden state of the LSTM.</li>
<li><code>num_layers</code>: the number of layers in the LSTM.</li>
<li><code>pad_token_id</code>: the token ID used for padding.</li>
<li><code>dropout_prob</code>: the dropout rate, defaulting to 0.3.</li>
</ul>

<p>The model comprises four main components:
1. <strong>Embedding Layer</strong>: Maps each token ID to a high-dimensional space (defined by <code>embed_dim</code>).
2. <strong>LSTM Layer</strong>: Processes sequences using <code>hidden_dim</code>, <code>num_layers</code>, and manages dropout.
3. <strong>Dropout Layer</strong>: Applied to the outputs of the LSTM for regularization.
4. <strong>Fully Connected Layer</strong>: Transforms the hidden state output to the size of the vocabulary for token prediction.</p>

<p>The <code>forward</code> method defines the forward pass of the model, which takes token IDs (<code>input_ids</code>) and optional hidden states (<code>hidden</code>). It processes the input through embedding, LSTM, and dropout layers sequentially, and finally through the fully connected layer to produce output logits and hidden states.</p>

<p>Additional methods:
- <code>predict_next_token</code>: Predicts the next token in a sequence given the current input IDs and the beginning of sequence (BOS) token ID, controlling the randomness of predictions with a <code>temperature</code> parameter.
- <code>generate</code>: Generates text from a given prompt and tokenizer setup, able to continue up to <code>max_length</code> tokens and selectively return just the generated continuation or the entire text including the prompt.</p>

<p>This setup makes the model particularly suited for tasks such as text generation, where sequences of tokens need to be predicted.</p>

<h2>File Summary</h2>

<p>This Python script, intended for execution on Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab, establishes a framework for experimenting with different types of language models using the PyTorch library. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Imports</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Core functionalities and models from PyTorch.</li>
<li>Utility functions related to tokenization, dataset creation, and model evaluations.</li>
<li>Various language model implementations such as GRU, LSTM, RNN, and Transformer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Setting Up the Environment</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperparameters for GRU, LSTM, RNN, and Transformer models are defined in a dictionary called <code>hyperparams_grid</code>.</li>
<li>Constants like paths for train and test datasets, tokenizer properties, vocabulary size, sequence length, batch size, and epochs are defined.</li>
<li>Configuration for the type of device (CPU/GPU) to run the model on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Preparation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Downloading and preparing corpus files.</li>
<li>Tokenization using a specially trained BPE tokenizer.</li>
<li>Loading datasets and creating batch loaders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The script contains a function, <code>run_experiments</code>, to systematically evaluate different model configurations from the defined hyperparameter grid.</li>
<li>Each configuration is used to instantiate, train, and evaluate a model while tracking the performance metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score.</li>
<li>The models are trained using saved data loaders that handle dataset batching and padding appropriately.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Experiment Execution</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Although customizable, by default the script seems set to run experiments for the GRU model type, as indicated by the final incomplete line. This implies manual selection and commenting/uncommenting lines to switch between model types like GRU, LSTM, RNN, or Transformer for running respective experiments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Potential Enhancements and Usage</strong>:
- To use this script effectively and to execute full experiments, a user would typically need to select the model type manually, possibly change hyperparameters, and might also ensure all dependent files and utilities are correctly implemented and imported.
- The code snippet is incomplete at the end but implies typical usage where you would specify the model type and possibly iterate over different types if automating comprehensive tests over multiple runs.
- The script seems well structured for modular experimentation with different neural network architectures in NLP applications, particularly for language modeling tasks.</p>

<h2>Top-level Functions</h2>

<ul>
<li>run_experiments: This function, <code>run_experiments</code>, systematically evaluates different configurations of models in a specified type (<code>model_type</code>) based on a configuration grid (<code>grid</code>). These models are either variants of a <code>transformer</code> or another unspecified type, instantiated through a provided <code>ModelClass</code>. The configurations differ primarily in parameters such as embedding dimensions, number of heads and layers (for transformers), or hidden dimensions (for other model types). For each configuration:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>A unique identifier (<code>model_id</code>) is generated for the model based on its type, index in the grid, and the current timestamp.</li>
<li>The function prints out the model being trained along with its configuration.</li>
<li>Depending on the <code>model_type</code>, either a transformer model or another model is initialized with specified parameters from the configuration grid and moved to the specified <code>device</code> for GPU computation (if available).</li>
<li>Each model is then trained and saved to disk (using <code>train_model</code> function), specifying learning rate from the config and constraining training to 50 epochs.</li>
<li>Post training, each model is evaluated using the <code>evaluate_model</code> function, which returns performance metrics such as perplexity (<code>ppl</code>) and BLEU score (<code>bleu</code>).</li>
<li>The results from each model evaluation are accumulated into a list with details on the <code>model_type</code>, <code>config</code>, <code>perplexity</code>, <code>bleu_score</code>, and local file path of the trained model (<code>model_path</code>). </li>
</ol>

<p>This function allows for the analysis of different neural network configurations' performances on training and testing datasets provided (<code>train_loader</code> and <code>test_loader</code>), leveraging the computational capabilities of the specified <code>device</code>.</p>
