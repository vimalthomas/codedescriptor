# gru_model.py

## File Summary
The `model.py` file defines a GRU-based neural network language model in PyTorch specifically tailored for generating text. Here's a summary of the key components and functionality of the script:

1. **Imports**: The script imports necessary modules from PyTorch including basic neural network layers and functional APIs.

2. **GRULanguageModel Class**: This class inherits from `nn.Module` and implements a language model using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layer. Its main components are:
   - `embedding`: Maps token indices to embeddings.
   - `gru`: A GRU layer for processing sequences of embeddings with support for dropout and multiple layers.
   - `dropout`: A dropout layer for regularization.
   - `fc`: A linear layer that projects the GRU output back to the vocabulary space.

3. **Constructor `__init__`**: Initializes the model parts and accepts parameters for vocabulary size, embedding dimension, hidden dimension of the GRU, number of GRU layers, padding token ID, and dropout probability.

4. **`forward` Method**: Defines the forward pass of the model which includes embedding the input tokens, passing them through the GRU, applying dropout, and then through a linear layer to get the logits for next token prediction.

5. **`predict_next_token` Method**: This method predicts the next token in the sequence given the current input ids and optional hidden state. It handles setting the model to evaluate mode, prevents logit explosion using temperature scaling, and blocks prediction of a beginning-of-sequence token by setting its logit to negative infinity.

6. **`generate` Method**: Facilitates text generation from a prompt. It encodes the given prompt using a tokenizer, initializes generation with optional device placement, and iteratively predicts next tokens until the end-of-sequence token is predicted or a maximum length is reached. It supports returning either the full text including the prompt or just the continuation after the prompt.

This class provides a comprehensive structure for text generation using a GRU model, with methods for predicting the next token and generating text given a starting prompt, making it suitable for applications in natural language processing tasks like text completion and automated writings.

Here's an outline of its functionality:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes the AdamW optimizer with a specified learning rate (`lr`) and a scheduler to reduce the learning rate based on the validation loss performance. A cross-entropy loss function integrates an 'ignore_index' for the padding token from the tokenizer.

2. **Training Loop**: Over a series of epochs (default 30):
    - **Train Phase**: For each batch from the `train_loader`, it computes the loss between the model outputs and targets, backpropagates to update model weights, and accumulates the train loss.
    - **Validation Phase**: The model is set to evaluation mode to prevent updates during validation. It calculates the validation loss for batches from the `test_loader`.
    - **Logging and Learning Rate Adjustment**: After each epoch, the average losses for training and validation are calculated and printed. The learning rate scheduler may adjust the learning rate based on the validation loss.
    - **Model Saving**: If the validation loss improves (i.e., decreases below the previously best recorded validation loss), the model's state dictionary is saved to the specified path.

3. **Loss Plotting**: After training, it plots the training and validation loss evolution over the epochs using a helper function, helping to visualize the model's learning progress.

The function effectively handles the entire training and validation process, including dynamic updates of learning parameters and tracking of performance metrics, while saving the best-performing model state.

- plot_losses: The provided function, `plot_losses`, takes three parameters: `train_losses` and `val_losses`, which are lists representing the loss during training and validation respectively, and an optional parameter `model_name` set to "model" by default. The function generates a plot displaying both the training and validation loss curves and titles the plot using the name of the model converted to uppercase followed by "Loss Curve". The x-axis represents epochs, and the y-axis represents loss. It includes a legend to differentiate between the training and validation curves.

The plot is saved as a PNG file named using the model name, the phrase "loss_curve", and the current timestamp to ensure the filename is unique. The function then closes the plot to free up memory and prints out a message indicating where the loss curve was saved, showing the filename. The filename includes a dynamically generated timestamp to ensure it is unique each time the function is run.

1. **Loading the Model**: The function starts by loading the model parameters from a saved state `model_path` using `torch.load`.

2. **Evaluation Mode**: Sets the model to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`), which turns off certain features like dropout.

3. **Loss Function**: Initializes a `CrossEntropyLoss` for the model, which ignores padded indices in sequences as defined by the tokenizer.

4. **Preparation for Metrics Calculation**: The variables `total_loss` and `bleu_scores` are initialized to accumulate the loss values and compute BLEU scores across all test data batches.

5. **Evaluation Loop**: Iterates over `test_loader` which contains batches of input and target sequences.
   - The function moves the current batch to the specified `device`.
   - It computes the logits of the model and evaluates the batch loss.
   - Accumulates the computed loss to `total_loss`.
   - Converts logits to predicted sequences and calculates the BLEU score for each predicted sequence compared to the ground truth, using a smoothing function to adjust the score computation.

6. **Calculation of Final Metrics**:
   - Computes the perplexity from the total loss accumulated across all batches.
   - Calculates the average BLEU score from scores obtained from individual predictions.

7. **Output**: Prints and returns the perplexity and the average BLEU score.

This function is valuable for evaluating translation models or other sequence generation tasks where alignment between the predicted sequence and the ground truth is important.

"<bos>" is added at the beginning if the first letter of the prompt is uppercase, and "<eos>" is appended if the completion ends with '.', '?', or '!'. It returns two lists containing the updated prompts and completions.

3. **Class `TextDataset` (inherits from `Dataset`):**
   - This class is used to handle a text dataset. It takes a file path, a tokenizer, and a maximum sequence length as inputs.
   - It parses a JSON file to extract text data, tokenizes the text, and truncates or pads it to a specified maximum length. The tokenized text objects are stored internally.
   - The `__len__` method returns the number of samples in the dataset.
   - The `__getitem__` method retrieves a text sample by its index, returning a version offset by one token as input and target, effectively setting up data for next-token prediction tasks.

   - This function is used for batching the data. It receives a list of samples and a padding value.
   - Inputs and targets are extracted, then padded to the maximum sequence length in the batch. It ensures that all data samples in a batch are of the same length, returning the batched inputs and targets.

This script is structured to facilitate the preprocessing and loading of text data, utilizing PyTorch's capabilities for efficient handling of sequences and batch preparation, which are essential steps in the pipeline of training models for natural language processing tasks.

## Classes
- TextDataset: The `TextDataset` class, derived from `Dataset`, is designed to process text data for natural language processing tasks. It initializes by loading text samples from a specified file and tokenizing them into numerical IDs using the provided tokenizer. The key steps and features of this class are as follows:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`):**
   - The constructor takes three parameters: `filepath` for the dataset file, `tokenizer` for converting text to tokens, and `max_seq_len` to limit the sequence length of tokens.
   - The text file is read line by line, and each line is expected to be a JSON object with keys 'prompt' and 'completion'. These values are concatenated, stripped of leading/trailing whitespace, and fed into the tokenizer.
   - The tokenizer encodes the concatenated text to produce a sequence of token IDs, capped at `max_seq_len`. The sequence includes beginning-of-sentence (`bos`) and end-of-sentence (`eos`) tokens.
   - Only sequences with at least 2 tokens are added to the dataset (`self.samples`).

2. **Length (`__len__`):**
   - This method returns the number of samples in the dataset.

3. **Item Access (`__getitem__`):**
   - Retrieves a specific sample by its index (`idx`). This method is used to access individual token sequences in the dataset.
   - For each sample accessed, it returns a pair of tensors: the input sequence (`tokens[:-1]`) and the target sequence (`tokens[1:]`). This setup is typical in language modeling, where the model predicts the next token in a sequence based on the previous tokens.

Overall, the `TextDataset` class neatly packages text data into manageable sequences useful for training language models, providing functionality to both preprocess and access the data efficiently.

## Top-level Functions
- add_special_tokens: The function `add_special_tokens` takes a tuple of two lists of strings as input, representing pairs of prompts and completions. It processes each pair to add special tokens: `<bos>` (beginning of sentence) is prepended to prompts that start with an uppercase letter, and `<eos>` (end of sentence) is appended to completions that end with punctuation marks (period, question mark, or exclamation point). The function returns a tuple containing two lists: one for the modified prompts and the other for the modified completions. This helps in marking the beginning and end points of sentences within the dataset, which could be useful for training language models or other NLP applications.

- collate_fn: The `collate_fn` function is designed to process a batch of data, ensuring that both inputs and targets are appropriately padded to the same length for batch processing in neural network models. Here's a step-by-step summary of what this function does:

1. **Unpacking the Batch**: The function takes two parameters: `batch`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an `input` sequence and a corresponding `target` sequence; and `pad_val`, which specifies the padding value to use for sequences shorter than the maximum length in the batch.

2. **Separating Inputs and Targets**: Using `zip(*batch)`, the function separates the inputs and targets from the batch into separate tuples.

3. **Padding the Sequences**: It uses the `pad_sequence` method from `nn.utils.rnn` for both `inputs` and `targets`. This method adjusts the length of all sequences in each tuple to match the longest sequence by adding the `pad_val` value at the end of shorter sequences. The `batch_first=True` argument ensures that the batch dimension is at the first axis (i.e., the shape of the output tensor will be `[batch_size, max_seq_length]`).

4. **Returning Processed Batch**: The function returns a tuple containing the padded `inputs` and `targets`.

This function is particularly useful when building models that handle sequences of varying lengths, such as those commonly found in natural language processing or time series analysis, allowing for efficient batch processing in deep learning architectures.

# rnn_model.py

## File Summary
This Python file defines a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) based language model using PyTorch. The model, named `RNNLanguageModel`, is implemented as a class that inherits from PyTorch's `nn.Module`. Here are the key functionalities and components of the model:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - The model is initialized with several parameters: `vocab_size` (size of the vocabulary), `embed_dim` (dimension of the embedding layer), `hidden_dim` (dimension of the hidden layer in RNN), `num_layers` (number of RNN layers), `pad_token_id` (padding token ID for embeddings), and an optional `dropout_prob` (probability for dropout layers).
   - The model architecture includes an embedding layer for token embeddings, a recurrent neural network (RNN) layer, a dropout layer for regularization, and a fully connected (linear) layer that outputs the logits representing the probability distribution over the vocabulary.

2. **Forward Pass (`forward`)**:
   - The `forward` method defines how the data flows through the model. It takes `input_ids` (token indices) and an optional `hidden` state as inputs. The method processes the input ids through the embedding layer, the RNN layer (where it optionally takes a hidden state), applies dropout, and then returns the output logits from the fully connected layer along with the new hidden state.

3. **Predict Next Token (`predict_next_token`)**:
   - This method is designed to predict the next token in a sequence given the current input tokens. It prevents the sampling of a beginning-of-sentence (`<bos>`) token, scales the logits by a temperature parameter (for controlling randomness), and applies softmax to convert logits to probabilities. The method then samples from these probabilities to get the next token and returns it along with the updated hidden state.

4. **Generate Text (`generate`)**:
   - This method generates text given a prompt. It uses the `predict_next_token` method in a loop to generate tokens up to a maximum length or until an end-of-sentence (`<eos>`) token is encountered. It supports returning either the full text (including the prompt) or just the continuation of the prompt. Text generation is controlled by parameters such as `device` (to place tensors on the correct hardware), `max_length`, `temperature`, and `return_continuation_only`.

Overall, this file provides a basic framework for training and using an RNN-based language model for generating text sequences, applicable in tasks such as autocompletion, chatbot responses, or other language generation tasks.

   - Offers an option to return only the continuation of the prompt or the entire generated sequence including the prompt.
   - Leverages the `predict_next_token` method for generating each subsequent token.

This model effectively encapsulates the typical functionalities of an RNN-based language model for tasks such as next-token prediction and text generation, using learned embeddings and recurrent dynamics.

# lstm_model.py

## File Summary
The Python file presents an implementation of an LSTM-based language model using PyTorch. The `LSTMLanguageModel` class, inheriting from `torch.nn.Module`, is defined within this file. Here's a summary of the key components and functionalities provided by this class:

1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method sets up the LSTM language model with configurable parameters including vocabulary size (`vocab_size`), embedding dimension (`embed_dim`), hidden dimensions (`hidden_dim`), number of layers (`num_layers`), padding token ID (`pad_token_id`), and dropout probability (`dropout_prob`). It initializes an embedding layer, LSTM layer, dropout layer, and a fully connected layer within the model architecture.

2. **Forward Pass**: Implemented in the `forward` method, it processes input tokens (`input_ids`) by first embedding them, then passing them through an LSTM network, applying dropout, and finally projecting the LSTM outputs to the vocabulary space using a linear layer. It returns the logits and the hidden states.

3. **Token Prediction**: The `predict_next_token` method predicts the next token given a sequence of input IDs, a beginning-of-sentence (`bos_id`) token to prevent its generation, hidden states, and temperature for smoothing. It outputs the predicted next token ID and updated hidden states, using softmax for probability distribution and sampling.

4. **Text Generation**: The `generate` method performs text generation starting from a provided prompt. It takes additional parameters such as the tokenizer, the device on which tensors are processed, maximal length for the generated text, temperature for controlling randomness, and a flag whether to return only the text continuation from the prompt. This method manages the sequence generation, token-by-token, stopping when an end-of-sentence token (`eos_id`) is generated or the maximum length is reached.

Overall, this model facilitates building a generative language model leveraging LSTM networks for tasks such as text prediction and generation, accommodating control of text diversity and coherency through temperature adjustments and structural configurations.

## Classes
- LSTMLanguageModel: The class `LSTMLanguageModel` is a PyTorch neural network model that extends `nn.Module`. It's designed to generate language based on an LSTM architecture. The model initialization receives several parameters to configure the LSTM and associated layers:

- `vocab_size`: the size of the vocabulary.
- `embed_dim`: the dimensionality of the embedding layer.
- `hidden_dim`: the number of features in the hidden state of the LSTM.
- `num_layers`: the number of layers in the LSTM.
- `pad_token_id`: the token ID used for padding.
- `dropout_prob`: the dropout rate, defaulting to 0.3.

The model comprises four main components:
1. **Embedding Layer**: Maps each token ID to a high-dimensional space (defined by `embed_dim`).
2. **LSTM Layer**: Processes sequences using `hidden_dim`, `num_layers`, and manages dropout.
3. **Dropout Layer**: Applied to the outputs of the LSTM for regularization.
4. **Fully Connected Layer**: Transforms the hidden state output to the size of the vocabulary for token prediction.

The `forward` method defines the forward pass of the model, which takes token IDs (`input_ids`) and optional hidden states (`hidden`). It processes the input through embedding, LSTM, and dropout layers sequentially, and finally through the fully connected layer to produce output logits and hidden states.

Additional methods:
- `predict_next_token`: Predicts the next token in a sequence given the current input IDs and the beginning of sequence (BOS) token ID, controlling the randomness of predictions with a `temperature` parameter.
- `generate`: Generates text from a given prompt and tokenizer setup, able to continue up to `max_length` tokens and selectively return just the generated continuation or the entire text including the prompt.

This setup makes the model particularly suited for tasks such as text generation, where sequences of tokens need to be predicted.

# llm_experiment.py

## File Summary
This Python script, intended for execution on Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab, establishes a framework for experimenting with different types of language models using the PyTorch library. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Imports**:
   - Core functionalities and models from PyTorch.
   - Utility functions related to tokenization, dataset creation, and model evaluations.
   - Various language model implementations such as GRU, LSTM, RNN, and Transformer.

2. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - Hyperparameters for GRU, LSTM, RNN, and Transformer models are defined in a dictionary called `hyperparams_grid`.
   - Constants like paths for train and test datasets, tokenizer properties, vocabulary size, sequence length, batch size, and epochs are defined.
   - Configuration for the type of device (CPU/GPU) to run the model on.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Downloading and preparing corpus files.
   - Tokenization using a specially trained BPE tokenizer.
   - Loading datasets and creating batch loaders.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - The script contains a function, `run_experiments`, to systematically evaluate different model configurations from the defined hyperparameter grid.
   - Each configuration is used to instantiate, train, and evaluate a model while tracking the performance metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score.
   - The models are trained using saved data loaders that handle dataset batching and padding appropriately.

5. **Experiment Execution**:
   - Although customizable, by default the script seems set to run experiments for the GRU model type, as indicated by the final incomplete line. This implies manual selection and commenting/uncommenting lines to switch between model types like GRU, LSTM, RNN, or Transformer for running respective experiments.

**Potential Enhancements and Usage**:
- To use this script effectively and to execute full experiments, a user would typically need to select the model type manually, possibly change hyperparameters, and might also ensure all dependent files and utilities are correctly implemented and imported.
- The code snippet is incomplete at the end but implies typical usage where you would specify the model type and possibly iterate over different types if automating comprehensive tests over multiple runs.
- The script seems well structured for modular experimentation with different neural network architectures in NLP applications, particularly for language modeling tasks.

## Top-level Functions
- run_experiments: This function, `run_experiments`, systematically evaluates different configurations of models in a specified type (`model_type`) based on a configuration grid (`grid`). These models are either variants of a `transformer` or another unspecified type, instantiated through a provided `ModelClass`. The configurations differ primarily in parameters such as embedding dimensions, number of heads and layers (for transformers), or hidden dimensions (for other model types). For each configuration:

1. A unique identifier (`model_id`) is generated for the model based on its type, index in the grid, and the current timestamp.
2. The function prints out the model being trained along with its configuration.
3. Depending on the `model_type`, either a transformer model or another model is initialized with specified parameters from the configuration grid and moved to the specified `device` for GPU computation (if available).
4. Each model is then trained and saved to disk (using `train_model` function), specifying learning rate from the config and constraining training to 50 epochs.
5. Post training, each model is evaluated using the `evaluate_model` function, which returns performance metrics such as perplexity (`ppl`) and BLEU score (`bleu`).
6. The results from each model evaluation are accumulated into a list with details on the `model_type`, `config`, `perplexity`, `bleu_score`, and local file path of the trained model (`model_path`). 

This function allows for the analysis of different neural network configurations' performances on training and testing datasets provided (`train_loader` and `test_loader`), leveraging the computational capabilities of the specified `device`.
